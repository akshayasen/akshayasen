#  Hey there! I'm Akshaya

I’m someone who loves finding stories hidden in data and turning them into insights that actually make sense.  
Over time, I’ve explored everything from **data analytics and visualization** to **machine learning and deep learning**, and I’m always curious to learn what’s next.

###  What I’m into
- Digging into datasets using **Python, SQL, and Excel**
- Creating **interactive dashboards** with Power BI & Tableau  
- Building and deploying **ML/DL models** using TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn  
- Experimenting with **AI projects** like CNN-based image classification and predictive models  
- Learning about **Agentic AI** and how automation is evolving with frameworks like CrewAI

###  Some of my favorite projects
-  **Lung Cancer Detection using CNN** – Classified CT images into 3 types of lung tissues with 94% accuracy.  
-  **Netflix Stock Price Forecasting** – Used ARIMA and LSTM models to predict prices with a 97% R² score.  
-  **Sales & Revenue Dashboard** – Visualized key KPIs in Power BI and Tableau to track business performance.  
-  **Phishing Website Detection** – Built and deployed a Random Forest model using Flask and Streamlit.  
-  **Airbnb Data Analysis** – Explored pricing patterns, host behavior, and location-based insights.

###  What I’m currently learning
I’m diving deeper into:
- **Agentic AI systems**
- **Advanced SQL queries for real-world analytics**
- **Cloud model deployment** using Streamlit and Flask

###  A bit about me
I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with ideas, and building projects that combine logic with creativity.  
When I’m not coding or working on dashboards, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech tools,  or brainstorming project ideas over a cup of coffee ☕.
